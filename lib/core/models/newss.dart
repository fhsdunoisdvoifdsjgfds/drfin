        '(Bloomberg) -- Oil steadied as the market monitored developments in Ukraine and the Middle East after US crude stockpiles rose for a third week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nParis to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees\n\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\n\nNew York’s Transit Agency Approves 9 Congestion Toll\n\nTokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\n\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\n\nBrent traded near 73 a barrel after losing 0.7% on Wednesday, and West Texas Intermediate was close to 69. Ukrainian forces expanded the use of Western-provided long-range weapons on Russian military targets, while the US says talks on a truce between Hezbollah and Israel made progress.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, crude inventories increased by 545,000 barrels last week, according to government data. The gain was significantly smaller than figures flagged by an industry report on Tuesday.\n\nOil has swung between gains and losses since mid-October, buffeted by a range of factors including concerns over Chinese demand and a stronger dollar. The market is facing a supply glut next year and investors are watching for a decision from OPEC+ on plans to start reviving idled supply.\n\n“We expect oil prices to test new lows next year as geopolitical risk subsides and bearish fundamental factors take great weight,” Macquarie Group analysts including Vikas Dwivedi wrote in a note dated Nov. 20. Futures are currently “range-bound with limited catalysts,” they added.',

    title: 'Exxon Mobil signs non-binding lithium supply deal with LG Chem',
    body:
        'By Ernest Scheyder\n\nHOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it has signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with battery parts maker LG Chem, the oil giant\'s second agreement to supply the electric vehicle battery metal from its proposed Arkansas project.\n\nExxon last year announced plans to extract lithium from the Smackover Formation, an underground deposit of salty water known as brine that stretches from Florida through Arkansas and into Texas, using at least one type of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology.\n\nExxon and other oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Equinor are increasingly investing in lithium projects, partly due to their belief that extracting the metal from brine involves similar processes as petroleum extraction.\n\nThe LG Chem agreement, which would require Arkansas officials to set a state lithium royalty rate to be finalized, is for up to 100,000 metric tons of the ultralight metal over several years.\n\nThe move allows Exxon - which plans to self-fund its Arkansas project - to incorporate LG Chem\'s lithium quality specifications into its design plans. South Korea-based LG Chem plans to use the lithium at its Tennessee cathode facility, slated to open next year.\n\n"This is about building a relationship with a company that has the same ambitions as building out the North American (battery) supply chain as us," Patrick Howarth, head of Exxon\'s lithium business, told Reuters.\n\nExxon expects lithium demand to rise despite U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\'s campaign vow to end the "EV mandate," Howarth said.\n\n"We know that the world\'s going to need a lot more lithium than it\'s producing today," he said.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal - including the price per metric ton of lithium that LG Chem would pay Exxon - would be negotiated as part of any final contract. SK On, a unit of SK Innovation, signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with Exxon in June.\n\nDespite recent lithium market turbulence, Howarth said Exxon has "seen really strong support from our potential customer base."\n\nROYALTY\n\nArkansas officials earlier this month rejected a proposed lithium royalty rate of 1.82% from Exxon and others.\n\nOfficials have been debating a lithium royalty since at least 2018, with tension centering on how the metal should be valued given the cost for equipment to filter it from brine, which unlike oil typically has no intrinsic market value.\n\nLandowners want a higher rate, noting that most U.S. oil royalties pay between 8% and 12%.\n\n"It\'s one of the key regulatory issues that we need to resolve to bring these projects to market," Howarth said, adding that Exxon could leave Arkansas - where it has invested more than 100 million - if the rate was too high.\n\nOfficials hinted a 2.5% rate could be acceptable, which Howarth said would be "in the range that we would be able to move forward." Exxon would need to formally propose a new rate, which is likely in the near future, he added.\n\nExxon declined to say how much lithium it expects to produce annually in Arkansas, although the amount would depend on which DLE technology it chooses.\n\n"We\'re definitely narrowing down the selection," Howarth said. "But we\'re still keeping multiple providers in play."',

        'ONEOK has announced an agreement to sell its three wholly owned interstate natural gas pipeline systems to DT Midstream for 1.2bn.\n\nThe deal includes the sale of the Guardian Pipeline, Midwestern Gas Transmission and Viking Gas Transmission.\n\nThis move is part of ONEOK\'s strategy to optimise its asset portfolio.\n\nThe 260-mile (418.4km) Guardian Pipeline interconnects with several pipelines near Joliet, Illinois, and serves Wisconsin. Midwestern Gas Transmission is a 400-mile bi-directional interstate pipeline connecting Tennessee to the Chicago Hub, while the 675-mile Viking Gas Transmission links Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota to Canadian supply.\n\nTogether, these pipelines cover approximately 1,300 miles and have a total capacity of more than 3.7bcf/d.\n\nONEOK president and CEO Pierce H. Norton II stated: "This transaction will align and enhance our capital allocation priorities within our integrated operating footprint.\n\n"DT Midstream is the ideal owner of these FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]-regulated interstate pipeline systems, with our employees sharing a similar culture of safety and reliability as they will continue to be excellent stewards of these assets providing essential natural gas transportation services.\n\n"This strategic move to optimise ONEOK\'s asset portfolio reinforces our standing as one of the largest diversified energy infrastructure companies delivering essential products and services."\n\nDT Midstream will gain 100% operating ownership of the pipelines, which are expected to support growth in the Midwest market region.\n\nThe acquisition aligns with the company’s strategy to own assets near key demand centres and market regions.\n\nDT Midstream president and CEO David Slater said: “Expanding our scale through this bolt-on natural gas pipeline acquisition fully aligns with our pure play natural gas strategy. This transaction also increases the revenue contribution from our pipeline segment, supported by take-or-pay contracts with strong credit quality utility customers.”\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary adjustments and pending regulatory approvals.\n\n"ONEOK to sell three interstate natural gas pipelines to DT Midstream for 1.2bn" was originally created and published by Offshore Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.',

Sentiment has turned increasingly cautious since the company said its first-quarter revenue grew at the slowest pace in more than a year as it struggled to monetize its lead in AI.\n\nAnalysts anticipate that the Beijing-based firm will announce a year-on-year drop in sales when it releases its results on Thursday. Options imply the stock will record a one-day move of 5.3% after the earnings. Baidu’s shares have declined 27% this year to trail the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index’s 2.8% gain.',

    body:
        '(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin hit 95,000 for the first time as the digital-asset sector moves to cement its influence with Donald Trump by pushing for a new White House post dedicated to cryptocurrency policy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nParis to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees\n\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\n\nNew York’s Transit Agency Approves 9 Congestion Toll\n\nTokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\n\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\n\nTrump’s team is holding discussions about whether to create such a role and the industry is pitching for the position to have direct access to the president-elect, who is now one of crypto’s biggest cheerleaders.\n\nThe talks are the latest US boost for digital-asset market sentiment, alongside Bitcoin accumulator MicroStrategy Inc.’s plans to accelerate purchases of the token and the debut of options on the nation’s Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe largest digital asset rose more than 2% in the US on Wednesday and extended the gain early in Asia on Thursday to a record high of 95,004. The crypto market as a whole consolidated gains after a more than 800 billion jump since Trump’s election victory on Nov. 5, based on data from CoinGecko.\n\nSpeculators are increasingly focused on whether Bitcoin will make a further leap to 100,000. Advocates of its claimed role as a modern-day store of value cherish the six-figure level as a rebuttal of skeptics who see little utility in crypto and decry its links to money laundering and criminal activity.\n\n“Buyers are strangling the sellers,” said IG Australia Pty Market Analyst Tony Sycamore. “While I’m not sure it’s all going to be smooth sailing as it edges closer to the 100,000 mark, the demand appears to be insatiable.”\n\nMicroStrategy, the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin, on Wednesday announced an almost 50% increase in planned sales of convertible senior notes, to 2.6 billion, to fund purchases of the token.\n\nThe once obscure software maker now bills itself as a Bitcoin treasury company and has a roughly 31 billion stockpile of the digital asset.\n\nTrump has vowed to create a supportive US regulatory framework for digital assets and set up a strategic Bitcoin stockpile. The timeline for implementation of his promises and the feasibility of the Bitcoin reserve remain uncertain. The president-elect used to be a crypto skeptic but changed tack after digital-asset firms spent heavily during election campaigning to promote their interests.',

    title: 'Applying AI and Analytics to Emissions Data',
    body:
        'There\'s little doubt about the impact of AI on businesses. When it comes to an organization\'s emissions data, it is generally understood that applying AI should bring useful insights from this critical data.\n\nIn terms of emissions data, companies are challenged in two areas. The first is driven by regulations requiring emissions reporting and ultimately emissions reduction over time. The second area relates to spotting business opportunities related to emissions such as investment credits available from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act for carbon sequestration and storage.\n\nUsing AI against large emissions datasets can highlight opportunities for emissions reduction relating to specific parts of a business or supply chain or opportunities for investment related to emissions.\n\nA prerequisite is that the data must be well organized and consistent. Consistency includes data and metadata for emissions activity, units of measure, the emissions calculation formula used and the emissions component category. The data consistency issue extends to organizational attributes describing the structure of the company\'s organizational boundaries, location, facility and equipment. It also extends to descriptions of product life cycles and the reporting domain.',

    body:
        'AI is everywhere these days and with good reason, as the ability of large language models (LLMs) to augment and speed up business processes is transforming how companies operate. Many of the scenarios discussed are what I\'d call "application" use cases. These are things like using ChatGPT to write marketing content, summarize a call center recording or even provide code for a bubble sort algorithm in Python. These are impressive capabilities but if you look at each example you\'ll notice they are specific generative asks. We use the LLM to provide a specific and relatively narrow business function. As AI improves, we\'ll start seeing complex business processes leveraging AI, which will have a tsunami effect on business. \n\nOne example of going beyond these generative application use cases is using AI to connect all the content sources that run our businesses. AI runs on data, as do all the companies I\'ve ever worked for. We collect and generate data via emails, slack threads, Zoom calls, finance reports and myriad other business applications. This data is a treasure trove of information on how to operate and optimize a business, and there are analytics applications that excel at digesting and analyzing this data. \n\nAt InMoment, we work on such applications and I can say with certainty that the most challenging part of our job is gaining access to all of these silos of information and figuring out how to normalize these disparate sources so we can look across the breadth of our customers\' data. There is an unspoken understanding in the industry that the hardest part of B2B software work is the data integration between systems. In this field, resolving data connectivity issues often paves the way for project success.',

    title: 'What your heart rate says about your fitness level',
    body:
        'A person\'s heart rate can say a lot about their fitness levels.\n\nWith the average smartwatch or fitness tracker, people have a wealth of information about their health and fitness, including their heart rate. From heart rate zones to variability, there\'s a lot of information at our disposal, but sometimes the meaning of all these statistics can get lost on those unfamiliar with them.\n\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Kathryn Larson recommends that patients determine their health and fitness goals first to identify what they plan to do with the information. She told The New York Times, "The discussion changes a lot based on what that patient or athlete wants to do with that data."\n\nExperts suggest measuring your heart rate - the number of heartbeats in a minute when you are not exerting yourself - without a device by finding your pulse in your neck or wrist to get the ball rolling. When you place your fingers by either, count the beats you can detect within 15 seconds, and multiply that number by four - that\'s how you\'ll find your heart rate.\n\nMeanwhile, your maximum heart rate can be determined by measuring how fast your heart beats during intense exercise, which is when fitness trackers like the Apple Watch come in handy. Throughout the day, devices like these can measure your heart rate through a tiny light that measures changes in the blood flowing through the vessels in your wrist. A healthy resting rate lies between 60 and 100 beats per minute, however, people with higher fitness levels like athletes will often have lower resting heart rates than less active people.\n\nWith this information, you can determine how you want to approach different zones of your heart rate and find out what you need to do to train them. Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Dr Tamanna Singh explained to the outlet, "The best way to really understand zones is by understanding the effort, and the purpose."\n\nFitness trackers can estimate your heart rate zones and inform you how to reach them in your workout. They can also help you design workouts that specifically target goals including building endurance and stamina.\n\nExperts recommend different exercises for each zone: zone one can be either a warm-up or a cool-down, zone two should be slightly more challenging but manageable for long stretches, zone three should be higher intensity and less sustainable, and zone four should be what you consider your threshold workout in which you max out.\n\nDevices can also calculate heart rate variability, which monitors how recovered or tired you are between workouts by tracking how your heart rate naturally fluctuates between beats. Lower numbers after a hard workout indicate that the person needs a longer recovery time while higher numbers show that the person can bounce back much quicker.\n\nHowever, experts note that fitness trackers aren\'t always reliable and can make mistakes, adding that prospective users shouldn\'t rely too much on the data. Dr Larson told the Times, "Any device is going to be detecting things accurately at times and also can be sometimes unreliable."\n\nShe recommends trying to talk while exercising to gauge your heart health, paying attention to this can be an easy way to monitor how you\'re doing without any fancy devices.',

    body:
        'Small businesses saw their wage bills surge by 14% at the end of last year in a sign of ongoing cost pressures across the sector, a report has shown.\n\nThe latest Sage small business tracker, compiled with the Centre for Economics and Business Research, found that while earnings growth is easing back more widely across the UK, total wage bills are continuing to rise for small firms at a rapid pace.\n\nIt showed that SMEs saw nominal wages increase by 13.8% in the final three months of 2023, up from growth 11.1% in the previous quarter.\n\nThis comes despite an easing in wage growth seen nationwide, with official figures on Tuesday revealing that regular pay, excluding bonuses, fell back to 6.1% in the three months to January – the slowest growth for more than a year.\n\nIt signals the ongoing wage cost pressures faced by small firms as they battle to attract and retain workers, even though other overheads are reducing, according to the report.\n\nThe report said: "Following the pandemic, wage growth within small businesses – as all businesses – has picked up markedly.\n\n"This reflects the ongoing tightness of the UK labour market, where workers have gained increased bargaining power, as well as the increased cost of living."\n\nSage said its data is "proving more volatile compared to the Office for National Statistics data, indicating small businesses experience more wage growth variability than the wider UK economy".\n\nThe figures from the report, which analyses anonymised Sage Accounting and Payroll data of more than 136,000 UK businesses, highlights that there are still underlying inflation pressures in the economy, which may hamper the Bank of England\'s battle to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.\n\nThe Bank has been keeping a close eye on wage data in particular in its bid to rein in inflation.\n\nBut with small firms still seeing their wage bills rocket higher and with the national living wage set to rise from £10.42 an hour to £11.44 from April for nearly three million people, there are fears that it may hamper the Bank\'s efforts on inflation.\n\nHowever, the report also flagged the resilience of the small business sector despite the woes in the economy.\n\nIt revealed small business revenues rose 0.9% on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, while average real underlying earnings surged 23.2% in the year to the fourth quarter, up from growth of 10.5% in the previous three months.\n\nThis comes despite the UK slipping into a technical recession in the final six months of 2023.\n\nThe report also found that, in spite of the steep increases in wage bills, overall cost pressures have started to abate, with real overheads falling by 1.8% in the year to the fourth quarter, which is the largest annual decline seen over 2023.\n\nDerk Bleeker, chief commercial officer at Sage, said: "Small businesses are continuing to show signs of weathering tough economic conditions."',
